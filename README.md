# NotesO3

##very very VERY WIP

I'm a student and this is my take on a note taking app. It's ment to replace OneNote for me, 'cause I don't realy like it from a note taking standpoint out and its Microsoft. 
I tried other programms (e.g Obsidian), but none had the ability to draw, write and structure my notes how I want it.
